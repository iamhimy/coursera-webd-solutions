                <div class="box"><h4>Chicken</h4>
                <p> Chicken is hard but gives an edgy taste to tongue.
                    It gives satisfaction and fulfillment while
                    chewing.It is the start of laying down a road of 
                    ecstacy from pan to a person's mouth. Chicken curry
                    is my favourite curry and with naan and salad it 
                    makes a perfect meal.
                    Chicken meat contains about two to three
                    times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.
                    Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded).<br>
                    The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 
                    4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein 
                    for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.<br>
                    Raw chicken maintains its quality longer in the freezer, as moisture is lost during cooking.
                    There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage.<br>
                    For optimal quality, however, a maximal storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for
                    uncooked whole chicken, 9 months for uncooked chicken parts, 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets,
                    and 4 months for cooked chicken.Freezing does not usually cause color changes in poultry, 
                    but the bones and the meat near them can become dark.<br> This bone darkening results when pigment seeps 
                    through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed.

                <div class="box"><h4>Beef</h4>
                <p> To improve tenderness of beef, it is often aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous 
                    proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished
                    using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals
                    (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support
                    growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.
                    <br>
                    Evaporation concentrates the remaining proteins and increases flavor intensity; the moldscan
                    contribute a nut-like flavor. After two to three days there are significant effects.
                    <br>
                    The majority of the tenderizing effect occurs in the first 10 days. Boxed beef, stored and
                    distributed
                    in vacuum packaging, is, in effect, wet aged during distribution. Premium steakhouses dry
                    age for 21 to 28
                    days or wet age up to 45 days for maximum effect on flavor and tenderness.
                    <br>
                    Meat from less tender cuts or older cattle can be mechanically tenderized by forcing small,
                    sharp blades through the cuts to disrupt the proteins. Also, solutions of exogenous proteolytic
                    enzymes (papain, bromelin or ficin) can be injected to augment the endogenous enzymes.<br>
                    Similarly, solutions of salt and sodium phosphates can be injected to soften and swell the
                    myofibrillar proteins. This improves juiciness and tenderness. Salt can improve the flavor,
                    but phosphate can contribute a soapy flavor.</p>

                    <h4>Sushi</h4>
                    <p> 
                        Sushi are the waves of excitement while
                        rafting in a ocean of taste. They make us take
                        time while eating so that we can explore every part of that ocean.
                        Sushi are orignally japanese food and it is quite populart across the world speacially among women.

                        Makizushi (巻き寿司, "rolled sushi"), norimaki (海苔巻き, "nori roll", used generically for other
                        dishes as well) or makimono (巻物, "variety of rolls") is a cylindrical piece formed with the help of a
                        bamboo mat known as a makisu (巻き簾). Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally
                        wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is usually cut into
                        six or eight pieces,
                        which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of makizushi,
                        but many other kinds exist.
                        <br>
                        Futomaki (太巻, "thick, large or fat rolls") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with
                        nori on the outside.[20] A typical futomaki is five to six centimetres (2 to 2 1⁄2 in)
                        in diameter.[21] They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen
                        for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival,
                        it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form,
                        where it is called ehō-maki (恵方巻, lit. happy direction rolls).[22] By 2000 the custom
                        had spread to all of Japan.[23] Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of
                        cucumber, kampyō gourd, takenoko bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of tamagoyaki
                        omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and oboro (food) whitefish flakes are typical
                        non-vegetarian fillings.[20] Traditionally, the vinegared rice is lightly seasoned with
                        salt and sugar. Popular proteins are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, egg, tuna, or shrimp.
                        Vegetables usually include cucumbers, lettuces, and takuan (沢庵) (pickled radish).<br>
                        Short-grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil
                        on nori, is nw becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is
                        mixed in makizushi rice. Nowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, 
                        boiled rice and cereals. Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may
                        include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy
                        tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, 
                        pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating. Tamago makizushi (玉子巻き寿司) is
                        makizushi is rolled out by a thin egg. Tempura Makizushi (天ぷら 巻き寿司) or Agezushi (揚げ寿司ロール)
                        is a fried version of the dish.<br>
                        Hosomaki (細巻, "thin rolls") is a small cylindrical piece, with nori on the outside.
                        A typical hosomaki has a diameter of about 2.5 centimetres (1 in).[21] They generally 
                        contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, kanpyō, nattō, umeboshi paste, squid
                        with shiso (Japanese herb). Kappamaki, (河童巻) a kind of Hosomaki filled with cucumber,
                        is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa.
                        Traditionally, kappamaki is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other
                        kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods.
